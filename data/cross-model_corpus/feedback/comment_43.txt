quick thoughts i played 25min went maybe 5-6 levels overall i like game it cool immersive concept i like tactical incentive forcing visitors split get lost die alone it clever other positives negatives observations different archetypes passive effects visitors room types customization layout - too easy i saw i never bothered use mental health strategy raw damages enough - i see enough variety market room cards i know still development frankly gets boring really fast even placing rooms feel deep engaging enough i feel construction management part game needs challenge it nt predictable i think needs additional rng layers make challenging the rng market enough it would cooler room could unstable collapse ? get exorcised ? would need placed next specific room types gain bonus maybe original intent game half roguelike deckbuilder also half polyomino board game that last part needs tension - i appreciate events paranormal stuff happening rooms what could place passive cards drain 1 energy per turn order spawn roaming autonomous zombie ? to summarize stance i like game especially thematic immersion i like chaotic challenge makes sense
