sure compared hades rest wicked combat flow nothing like games this like top-down monster hunter you break monster parts craft weapons armors meta-progression upgrades along way combat ok lot animation locking feel smooth due slow nature monster hunter game lot slower action roguelike really work want runs take long time fights feel like theyre slow the main reason negative review felt like upgrades runs felt super lackluster nothing get felt like increased power changed playstyle run really feel fresh felt super repetitive 1-2 runs
