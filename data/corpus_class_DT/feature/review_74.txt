Small suggestions First like say think game improved lot since demo It good even better One improvement I REALLY like doors opened highlighted take away little guessing awww ! moments progress general gameplay standpoint nice A small suggestions though - - When run heart health zoom-to-heart death animation heart explodes rots greys etc would great instead panning simply moving right died screen A human walked room barely even knew heart top corner screen saw feet - When new cards unlocked specifically room cards mousing unlock screen show summary room actually Weapon room ? That cool guess wait next game see actually - As people mentioned mouse control slightly It little slower default hardware cursor speed seems minor acceleration enabled Not horrible still little awkward - I sure considered may challenging implement able tilt turn camera would great It degrees angle would normally choose probably lot work switch static viewpoint Aside really like direction game going Well done devs Fun game playing sure
