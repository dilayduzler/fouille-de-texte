This game genuinely blows away I even say enough good things Slay Spire probably favorite game first StS-like I ever played anywhere near depth StS It actually pulls sandbox feeling clone ever come close I probably played 25 different roguelike deckbuilder Slay Spire Clones probably every one heard Probably half version StS grid combat This first one I ever played genuinely greater sum parts This actual innovation make something amazing unique The important thing So Much Content I tried demo early access I remember saying demo cards almost StS clones I ever played There must like 500 cards I idea many Relics Components card upgrades The gimmicks fleshed combine ways actually allow clever emergent gameplay patterns To draw comparison StS I give Silent Shivs An example gimmick equivalent depth StarVoiders would Bombs I ended bomb deck 6 times I actively remember runs They used almost entirely different cards relics time played completely different one another moment-to-moment decision making Bombs one probably 50 gimmicks similar depth complexity across 3 mechs StS characters unique pools cards 9 pilots starting sets gimmicks This game insane
