So simplified list find Terraria - This 2D RPG platformer sandbox elements - It incredible amount content - Multiple classes shaped armor bonuses use items class - Idk like billion items ? Lots weapons armor cosmetics building material It crazy - A good healthy serving cool interesting bosses fight - Lots NPC buy stuff ready build basically hotel like 30 game - Really good retro soundtrack modern fit creative environments pair Boss fight music gets pumped ! - Is easy ? Try Expert mode ! Don feel like penalized enough dying ? Set character Hardcore ! - I almost forgot mention SO MUCH CRAFTING Cons ? Hmm - Inventory management abundance items overwhelm I usually make structure dedicated storing loot chests Stay organized ! - Fishing pretty useful well exactly exciting You get great stuff way though - Expect big difficulty spike defeating boss Underworld ! You feel like noob work past game feels like truly begins - Some items game pretty rare rares used craft otherwise obtain best loot game Other thought - If play friends find people run game It much fun way You still enjoy quite bit single player however laugh someone gets destroyed boulder trap Story time want torture read rambling I bought game ages ago back still development expansions cleanups gone I spent 10 Since Dev team least back 2014-2015 I kept would post threads month least let people know planned progress game It kept getting updated adding content mechanics I remember super excited new weapon types added rare mounts added Accessories character fly around map ? Gimme Something I always admire Re-Logic simply focus adding stuff end game kept polishing early game adding things like Ropes make things easier get hookshots simple versions weapons find later like Spears wooden yo-yo early game magic items It used much less enjoyable slower grind get mid game content pace picks There least couple times development game supposedly going halt I satisfied I gotten content enjoyment Terraria games I bought 30 Yet somehow maybe year hearing nothing new content update would surprisingly pushed This happened least twice I thought would laid rest I spent 10
