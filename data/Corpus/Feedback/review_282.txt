Booooring Edit Since I received clown rewards noticed negative reviews I felt need update review This fun game The animation art sound design present honestly top quality reason execution whole package falls flat due lackluster gameplay It kind ironic Turkish indie games usually opposite issue good gameplay poor art direction And context I played object-finding games past like I completely unfamiliar genre They made poorly I claiming master game design area even first scenes finding objects felt like chore rather something enjoyable I played hundreds games give one pass simply Turkish I believe overwhelmingly positive reviews mostly due game somewhat well-known within Turkish indie game community But affect anyone review Internationally game received attention I believe would roasted ended 60 70 Metacritic score It really sad hyped-up games par low-quality titles international developers P S Works well Steam Deck
