While game boasts incredible visuals detailed animations intense action sequences I found conflicted overall experience The storyline fell short Character deaths often felt unnecessary many protagonists made decisions difficult relate ultimately made hard connect care outcomes This mean bad game big expectation since first one amazing The roguelike mode highlights much fun combat without need nonsensical story Overall would recommend game story
