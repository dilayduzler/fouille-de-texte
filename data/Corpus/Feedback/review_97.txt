You probably look counter-arguments Terraria frustrated find dumb fake reviews telling buy viewing negative terrria lmao lol kk Well I tell truth I think excellent game things watch necessarily cons things personally might dislike - This nature premise look game The game improved lot aspect giving ways find things still nearly enough Like Minecraft GMod Don Starve game type probably better wiki open times - This grindy game Whenever I start campaign I usually put podcast music lot gameplay mindless Especially move past big shift midgame find lot situations way move forward go specific location grind start specific event grind It much type game There mods solve want I talking specifically vanilla game even mods really escape fact meat game pretty much grind getting less meat case - That also plays next point game long It NOT concise game If taking slow putting effort building trying explore much etc might play 100 hours game even close - This game piss easy Even Expert Mode child game experience breeze With later updates added new Master Mode actually difficult essentially damage slider kind difficulty really fun interesting Again mods fix adding new difficulties far better thought make game way interesting less stale - While playing alone still fun valid game improves tenfold playing people Adding people mix makes sooo much better breathes new life game It unfortunate multiplayer coded like Not game becoming way demanding system exclusively multiplayer especially host unless playing LAN something lag basically inescapable To play Terraria multiplayer come terms fact game become unplayable complete random hope important fight Just getting stomach This negative review per se I still think Terraria amazing game look playtime ! seriously pissing
