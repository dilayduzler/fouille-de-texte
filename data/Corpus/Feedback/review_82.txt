I love game see come years switch PC awhile made love game even ! When BIG update game like relearn game fresh start ! journeys end update ! They keep bringing back I hope stop updating making switch software use game codded instead making seperate game would better call update verses Terraria 2 So yes new game I highly recommend try ! slow first start discovering things end hours game !
