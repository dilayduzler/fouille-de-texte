We need Mod Profiles Seriously different mod profiles standard rn I lightly modded multiplayer game beginning Act 3 However I would love start Singleplayer Game heavily modded But since I would manually switch mods time even updating mod party members updated already keep us playing I started run yet Could I write mods versions use run manually activate deactivate every time ? Of course Do I want ? Absolutely From surface-level knowledge programming mod managers general implementing mod profiles difficult require internal script corresponding UI players determines mods version gets loaded So please I would love get implemented Bonus points could export import profiles party members multiplayer manually pick mods load host lobby
