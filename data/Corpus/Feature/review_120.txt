A mission editor could _so_ cool ! Ey chooms ! Now continue I well aware amazing Appearance Menu Mod allows edit lot stuff even set triggers thus basically creating encounters But end still hack Not mention encounters set basically random encounters always remain map Instead I talking allowing us set semi-official side activities also manifest icon For example gigs green exclamation mark perhaps ? requests help red hostile markers maybe ? So comparable stuff AMM mod exception save work appear map This could also tie Steam workshop I help convinced CDPR would get contact authors behind AMM difficult get basic routines going And would allow community create tons extra contents share stories NC Ey one hope right ?
