My first impressions game Recently bought Cyberpunk discount And I say After time - game perfectly polished good But one thing Pissed Night City truly vibrant atmospheric city The buildings well-designed various NPCs decorations But Where hell parking ! ? This heavily motorized city cars every turn But parking ! What hell ! ? This really ruins atmosphere Next Why bike paths electric scooters electric bicycles city FUTURE ? Well okay explanation Corporations lobbied ban people would buy expensive personal transport But buses ! ? This VERY overpopulated city And corporations certainly ban BUSES 90 percent residents physically drive cars This huge city And buses simply MUST Where taxis ? What nonsense ? How could THIS missed ? Even cheap GTA clones pay attention Okay I understand It late add parking The city layout would need changed significantly But least add buses bus stops ! That would improve city atmosphere 35 percent
