I like make suggestions improve game areas I completely satisfied Something I like character ask one companions take dialogue conversation For example NPC starts dialogue mage I give conversation paladin warlock ? My mage right shy ! Post-Game This game genuinely needs New-Game could perfect companions builds fun level 12 spells skills start In addition entire game would leveled level 12 characters could make game challenging much fun Something would also great coliseum mode mode could battles game bosses defeated legendary actions included level scaled In mode could unlock kind currency allows us improve weapons armor one level coin used item I mean Uncommon Rare Very Rare Legendary Something fundamental game style customization give blacksmiths tailors ability change appearance color armor clothes This would eliminate dye bottles game currently bit disappointing It striking companions interactions world unless take really none group want go walk take care tieflings mention useful could certain events inn act 2 I know small thing give background scars tattoos creation menu obviously player obvious limitations perhaps partner could ask scar tattoo react answer Please add official artificer class extremely strange use class magic robots throughout game could excellent allies final battle It would possible add romantic options especially bard full romances something sporadic even animation fade black dialogue afterwards Is much ask necromancer turn enemies undead slaves maybe help certain book ? It would something similar mercenaries interesting former enemies Obviously limit would needed perhaps maximum 5 non-dead slaves This personal request would possible give humans extra Feat character creation limit usually used example Feats like Lucky Magic Initiate Bard Magic Initiate Cleric Magic Initiate Druid Magic Initiate Sorcerer Magic Initiate Warlock Magic Initiate Wizard Etc I would love create lucky introverted artificer PS Sorry text errors English native language
