Quick thoughts I played 25min went maybe 5-6 levels Overall I like game It cool immersive concept I like tactical incentive forcing visitors split get lost die alone It clever Other positives negatives observations Different archetypes passive effects visitors Room types Customization layout - Too easy I saw I never bothered use mental health strategy Raw damages enough - I see enough variety market room cards I know still development frankly gets boring really fast Even placing rooms feel deep engaging enough I feel construction management part game needs challenge It nt predictable I think needs additional RNG layers make challenging The RNG market enough It would cooler room could unstable collapse ? get exorcised ? would need placed next specific room types gain bonus Maybe original intent game half roguelike deckbuilder also half polyomino board game That last part needs tension - I appreciate events paranormal stuff happening rooms What could place passive cards drain 1 energy per turn order spawn roaming autonomous zombie ? To summarize stance I like game especially thematic immersion I like chaotic challenge makes sense
