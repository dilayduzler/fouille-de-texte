I deeply looking forward game enjoying demo lot However full game really add much The game enough variety gameplay options really warrant 20 price tag In addition game billed Roguelite progression runs Each run start house layout cards calendar days ahead events As progress single run unlock upgrade cards rooms happen enough make feasible use offset massive spikes difficulty When run lose keep upgrades unlock new modes features start exactly back beginning exact cards layout calendar Also EVERY run makes run stage-setting tutorial cards This extremely disappointing premise good demo SO promising full game deliver price tag way high offered If developers add features cards new modes alternate starts progression runs way skip first tutorial cards balance difficulty spikes reducing powers certain characters increasing amount upgrades run I could possibly turn review direction I fairly bummed game
