2; "I usually skip on playing action shooter games, that's why I wasn't that hyped when Cyberpunk was being released. It will haunt me forever to know that was it not for the Edgerunners anime, I would most likely not play this game at all. Missing out on this gaming jewel would truly be tragic. I am not being hyperbolic, the only critique I have for this game is the limited romance options, but I will spare everyone the several paragraphs about how unfair it is not being allowed to romance Viktor Vektor and Goro Takemura. To be completely honest, it is not even that big of a deal. In fact while the romance part of this game is cute, it could be skipped entirely without it taking away from the absolute perfection this game is.";Feedback
3; "Still an insane buggy mess lacking polish. Idk what game everyone else is playing but this is No Mans Sky still. Everyone says it's fixed, it's not. So many little things that pull you out of the immersion, so many still missing features. It kind of feels like Star Citizen in terms of the level of polish atm. Lots of pretty stuff but none of it works well without jank. I took a screenshot of Keanu Reeves and now my game literally cannot open after it crashed and I rebooted and reinstalled.";Bug

18; "Fun for a few hours. There are some very fun mechanics, but overall, it's lacking. Really, this game makes me sad they didn't expand upon it more. It's so close to being so spectacular, but let me explain:  - Combat is knee deep at most. It never advances past dodging and swinging your weapon / shooting a bow. While this would be mostly fine, it's not helped by the fact you can't aim your attack: you can only attack in the direction you're facing. This makes the combat extremely clunky at best, and infuriating at worst. - Enemies are varied, but shallow. While the enemy variety is good, both in visuals and attacks, the shallow combat really harms them. Fundamentally, there are only a few kinds of enemies with remixed attacks, skins, and combos. While this is _fine_ it's not great. - Bosses are actual garbage. Every single one boils down to face tanking, or dying to impossibly poorly telegraphed attacks (stone golem teleport and trees nuts are just two examples). Combined with the handful of largely similar weapons, this is exhausting as well, and feels REALLY ♥♥♥♥ when you die to "oh, guess I don't have enough health. Let me just run that almost identical dungeon for the 100th time" - Prices finding is a very fun idea, but in practice is just annoying. Having to guess prices based on customer reactions is a really fun, clever idea I really wish was fleshed out more. But the prices always being the same except for the +/- 20% for high and low demand completely invalidates the mechanic to being annoying. - Inventory management is great. I really, really enjoy the various curses and trying to line them up, it's very fun. However, having 100 different items that are just sell junk is pointless and annoying. It makes the game feel more full, but doesn't contribute to anything other than worrying about what you should sell. - Story is almost completely absent. While this isn't inherently a problem (look at stardew valley), the lack of meaningful characters and dialog sucks. The art is so good, the world is so lively, and it feels like there is so much to do. But other than a few sign posts with legs as merchants, there isn't anyone to inhabit this world. The ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ _builder_ has more character than the blacksmith and alchemist you interact with regularly. Seriously, wtf???";Feedback
19; "Unable to start the game. After entering the initial screen, clicking any button will return to the initial screen. I even bought DLC and the same problem occurred. There is no problem with the integrity of the game, I could play it three years ago, why not now?";Bug

21; "Graphics are nice, but combat feels stiff and sluggish, enemies can attack from any direction but you can only attack in the 4 cardinal ones. The game constantly stops you early on so you can watch the slowest NPC walk across the screen or listen to them ramble on about the standard boring story. If you're looking for your next rogue-lite game, look elsewhere.";Feedback
22; "man, i dont know, i cant even play the game. WASD and J does not even work on main menu. great game, but controls on KB is so bad. no wonder i refunded this game.";Bug
23; "It's fun for a while, but it's shallow, and there's not a lot of content. It feels like the basic framework that could've been vastly expanded upon, but right now it's lot of very basic gameplay systems.  You have your procedurely generatored dungeons, with 4 different environments and bosses (the bosses CANNOT be refought in any way, a very strange decision for a rogue-lite game). Enemies get slightly stronger on every floor, with 4 floors per dungeon, and they drop items you can sell or craft with.  You have your standard overhead 2D combat with lite and charge attacks on 5 different weapons. You do not gain extra combat abilities as the game goes on, and the weapons only do more damage or sidegrade to some light status effects. Combat stays the same.  You have your shop in which you ostensibly play a merchant, putting things on sale, but really this isn't much different than selling things to a vendor in other games, just slower. Every item has an internal best price you can sell to your customers at, and once you find it, that's it. There's an "item popularity" mechanic, but it doesn't affect much of anything. There's shop customization, but it's much shallower than in Recettear. You can basically just expand the space, and install items to provide flat bonuses. There is no customization of shop ambiance to attract different customers or cosmetic touches.  There's crafting, which basically means you pay money at the town billboard to unlock shops before you can buy from them. The village outside your shop is pretty lifeless, with a lot of nameless NPCs that have 1-3 lines of dialogue that never change. Some inexplicably have portraits, hinting that NPC stories or quests that were planned but never put in. Weapons crafting is also very strange in that you can craft completely separate lines of either Physical or Elemental based weapons, but the elemental weapons have a specific element per tier, so you can't have say, a fire based elemental weapon of the highest level, only lightning. This is a hugely missed opporunity to beef up the enchanting system, which only allows you to buy a flat attack damage or defense upgrade to your weapons/armor.  In short a bunch of different gameplay elements mixed together can be more than the sum of its parts, but this doesn't happen in Moonlighter. Everything feels very separate and still basic. The combat starts ok, and fails to get more interesting. the dungeons start ok, and then just become very easy as you learn without any major surprises. The boss fights are fun, but there's only 4 + the final boss and you can't do a boss rush or replay the fights. The shop only has one or two mechanics behind it for the entire game. There's an interesting concept here, but the devs were only able to do the minimum with it.";Feedback
24; "Honestly the big appeal of Moonlighter are its graphics and the trading system.  Beside these two, the games lacks a lot. I finished the entire game abusing the second attack of the long sword which gives you invulnerability during its animation.  The aren't a lot of biomes or monsters and it's very repetitive. After a while even the trading system loses its appeal and you're just grinding for a better weapon to conquer a "dungeon" to grind for yet better weapons and conquer another "dungeon" and using the assistant to sell the stuff for you.  I gotta say that the story is pretty interesting and it was nice to see glimpses of the history of each "dungeon" through the description of the items.  TL,DR I don't think this game is worth buying because there are a lot better options out there that provide way more enjoyment. If you really want to try the trading system, wait for sale.  Do not buy this game at full price!";Feedback
25; "Moonlighter is first and foremost a dungeon crawling game with strong memories of Legend of Zelda. Meanwhile the shop management segment will rarely have you shouting "Capitalism, ho!"  PROS: + Would you wrap your eyes around those pixels - It looks quite nice! The bosses and monsters all look colourful and impressive and everything moves with a silky smoothness that is both pleasant and delightful. + Inventory Management? - Somehow they've made inventory management fun and puzzling! Trying to avoid all of your items exploding in a fit of curses turns the whole experience into it's own little puzzle to solve + Keep your belly to the floor in those dungeons! - As you're dungeon... crawling. It's fun. They're effective and interesting and there's a constant tension as you go for one more room, only to die and lose everything.  CONS: - Shopkeeper? I hardly know her! - The shop keeping aspect is incredibly light and lacking. Working out the right price for an item is fun, but it ends there immediately. There's not much going on in your shop. - Help I'm part of the 1% and don't know what to do - Money money money, could be funny, in a rich man's world. You'll have lots of money, too much money. There's nothing to spend it on. Upgrading your equipment only costs so much so why are you really selling anything? - There's a lack of soul - In the most capitalistic aspect of the game, it feels like it just lacks sense of soul. The town itself is devoid of personality and you rarely interact with another character outside of Old Man Jenkins. - Haven't I been here before? - The dungeons do become a little repetitive as all you eventually want to do is progress to the next dungeon but you've got to go through yet another full dungeon run to get to the final floor, aaaaaah.  Moonlighter is by no means bad, it's 'alright'. It's shop management aspect suffers heavily from just having very little managment to it. Honestly, I'd rather have the well known game from 2007, as at least that didn't have the option to hire someone else to do the shop keeping aspect for you, removing half of the game. Capitalism, ho!";Feedback
26; "The concept is good in theory but it really lacks depth. The entire game is very mindless and you just grind until you make progress.  Hell, I beat the final boss just by walking up to him, mashing the attack button, and using potions until he died before I did. I literally spared no thought to his attacks and I won on my first try.";Feedback
27; "I wanted to like this game, we don't see enough supernatural farming sims- And i gave it a damn good shake, on a couple occasions. Unfortunately, i've only come to the conclusion that this game is a buggy, broken, busy, stressful and overly bloated mess. I don't know how they've made something so lackluster and so overly busy at the same time, but they did.  Not to mention all the pointless dlc packs instead of fixing problems, and the recent controversies surrounding the treatment of their workers and such.  Sunhaven is, sadly, really not worth your money or time. Maybe go check on the progress of 'fields of mistria','moonlight peaks' and 'coral island' instead- none of them are fully released yet- but all of them are ore promising then sunhaven.";Bug

Additionally its a skill level game where you choose the upgrade each level up and I LOVE that about the game. Additionally, it has loads of romance options unlike some games where the choice is really minimal. Not just that you really love most of the characters too and find it hard to choose which to marry! The story line is really interesting and with the fact that there is not just 1 town is so fun and interesting. I super reccomend this game!!!";Feedback

Yes, I know the concept of the game won't changes but having to converse with Emily and Evelynn like I didn't spend the prior 2 hours of my life walking on eggshells around them was weird, I had to re:get to know the characters and I was forced to date either of them and to be honest after playing 2 I had a distaste for both Emily and Evelynn. The ending I got was anti-climactic. I don't think I need to elaborate and I don't think I need to play this again to prove myself wrong. I'm disappointed.

I started using a different pair of bluetooth headphones (connected via wire) with a Realtek Audio driver (default for Win 10), when I encountered a strange audio bug.  It is a ticking sound that appears to play every in-game 'tick'. If I pause the game, the sound stops, when I set game speed to normal, it 'ticks' every day, and when I set the speed to fast, the sound becomes more frequent as the days change faster.  I've purged all the mods, verified the game files and reinstalled the game, but the bug is still there. Besides, I've tried moving different volume sliders, but even if I turn all of them to the lowest value, the sound persists, so it shouldn't be caused by any in-game audio. I've also changed my audio driver to Realtek High Definition audio, but it didn't solve the issue. I've borrowed a pair of gaming headphones from a friend and used them with the Razer drivers for testing and the sound was gone, so it's the audio drivers that seem to be the reason.";Bug

From my very surface-level knowledge of programming and other mod managers in general, implementing mod profiles should not be difficult at all and should only require an internal script and a corresponding UI for the players that determines which mods and which version of it gets loaded.

62; "Please change the facial expression of Tav while kissing ascended Astarion It doesn't make sense for Tav to be scared or angry during the kiss animations because they CHOSE to ascend him and KNEW what was coming when THEY ASKED to turn them into a spawn (or more accurately a vampire bride because of the way he turned Tav).  To me it just seems that the people from Larian don't know what route to go with ascended Astarion. In one moment he is really sweet and caring (which makes sense cuz a vampire Lords purpose after creating a bride is to make them happy, cuz they have this special psychic emotional connection. Happy wife, happy life so to speak). And then during the kiss animations she is just terrified out of nowhere and it wouldn't make sense cuz then the bride would obviously be unhappy.  I have seen a lot of people on Youtube being upset about this change. Not the kiss animations themselves, they are great and really fit with his dominant behaviour that he gained from the ritual. But the facial expressions for Tav just don't fit.  In some dialogue for origin Karlach during the epilogue he even says that he let her go because he isn't a monster like Cazador and that he will wait for her when she finds a way to return so they can spend their life together. This is when she went to the hells.  Everything about ascended Astarion just seems so inconsistent from Larian and it is really frustrating. Like they really want you to go the spawn route. I like his spawn version too but imo the ascension route just is how any Vampire is. Plus it's fantasy, not real life.

65; "I'd like to make some suggestions to improve some of the game's areas that I'm not completely satisfied with.  Something I don't like is that our character can't ask one of the companions to take over the dialogue during a conversation. For example, if an NPC starts a dialogue with my mage, why can't I give the conversation to the paladin or the warlock? My mage has the right to be shy!  Post-Game. This is a game that genuinely needs a New-Game +, with this we could perfect our companions' builds and have fun with level 12 spells and skills from the start. In addition to the above, the entire game would have to be leveled for level 12 characters, which could make the game challenging but much more fun.  Something that would also be great is a coliseum mode, in this mode we could have battles against the game's bosses that we have defeated, but with legendary actions included and with a level scaled to our own. In this mode we could unlock some kind of "currency" that allows us to improve our weapons and armor by one level for each "coin" used in that item. (I mean Uncommon, Rare, Very Rare and Legendary)  Something that is fundamental for a game of this style is customization, so why not give blacksmiths and tailors the ability to change the appearance and color of our armor and clothes. (This would eliminate the dye bottles from the game, which are currently a bit disappointing).  It is striking that our companions have no interactions in the world unless we take them, really none of those who are not in the group want to go for a walk or take care of the tieflings, not to mention how useful they could be in certain events in the inn of act 2.  I know this is a small thing, but we couldn't give some background to scars and tattoos in the creation menu, obviously up to the player, but with obvious limitations. (perhaps our partner could ask about the scar or tattoo and react to the answer).  Please add an official artificer class, it's extremely strange that we can't use this class when there are magic robots throughout the game and they could be excellent allies in the final battle.  It would be possible to add more "romantic" options, especially for the bard, they don't have to be full romances, just something sporadic, they don't even have to have an animation just a fade to black and some dialogue afterwards.  Is it too much to ask that with a necromancer we can turn our enemies into undead slaves, maybe with the help of a certain book? It would be something similar to mercenaries, but more interesting, because they are former enemies. (Obviously a limit would be needed, perhaps a maximum of 5 non-dead slaves)  This is a more personal request, would it be possible to give humans an extra Feat at character creation, but limit it to those that are not usually used, for example, Feats like, Lucky, Magic Initiate: Bard, Magic Initiate: Cleric, Magic Initiate: Druid, Magic Initiate: Sorcerer, Magic Initiate: Warlock, Magic Initiate: Wizard, Etc.

90; "I've never actually taken the time to write out a real review of a game, but this one absolutely deserves it.  Terraria was my first ever game on PC and was the entire reason for me getting one. I had originally started playing the game on my Xbox 360, only to later beg my parents to buy me a computer so that I could play the 1.2 update. After that, I spent hours grinding through the game. It was shortly after my first time completing the game during 1.2 that I played the game again with friends. Though not a memorable experience in of itself, it did pave the way for those friendships to evolve further.  Then we get to the release of the 1.3 update in the summer of 2015. I absolutely lost my sh*t for this update. For months my friends and I planned to play through the game again and spend time exploring all the new content. That was my first character that ever surpassed 100 hours of playtime.  After that initial playthrough with my friends, I would periodically revisit the game on my own and with my friends for years. Sometimes there would be mods, sometimes it would be the original experience. Regardless of how I played, I never ever got bored with the game. I may only have 1600 hours across 6 years, but each one of those hours was spent in the game having a blast and completing my saves for each character I played on.  With the Journeys end update coming out earlier this year, an update I have played through and through, I have finally managed to scrounge up the courage to say goodbye to this game. That doesn't mean that I'm going to stop playing it, that will never be a feasible option to me, especially with a game that has shaped my childhood. This review serves as a ode to an amazing game that has changed my life, as well as a way for me to cope with the game no longer receiving updates.  I will forever thank the wonderful company of Re-Logic for an amazing product and the community that has surrounded the game for sharing such a novel game with me.  Goodbye Re-Logic, and I look forward to future endeavors.  Sincerely, Katie Dixon AKA KittoMen";Feedback
91; "So, here's a simplified list of what you'll find in Terraria:  - This is a 2D RPG with platformer and sandbox elements - It has an incredible amount of content to it - Multiple classes that are shaped through armor bonuses (but you can use other items not of your class) - Idk like a billion items? Lots of weapons, armor, cosmetics, and building material. It's crazy - A good healthy serving of cool and interesting bosses to fight - Lots of NPC's to buy stuff from (be ready to build basically a hotel for the like 30 of them in the game now) - Really good retro soundtrack but more modern, that fit the creative environments they pair with. Boss fight music gets you pumped! - Is it too easy for you? Try Expert mode! Don't feel like you're penalized enough for dying? Set your character to Hardcore! - I almost forgot to mention… SO MUCH CRAFTING  Cons? Hmm.  - Inventory management… the abundance of items will overwhelm you. I usually make a structure dedicated to storing all my loot in chests. Stay organized! - Fishing is pretty useful but… well it's not exactly exciting. You can get some great stuff that way though. - Expect a big difficulty spike after defeating the boss in the Underworld! You'll feel like a noob all over again, but once you work past it is where the game feels like it truly begins for me. - Some items in the game are pretty rare and some of these rares are used to craft or otherwise obtain some of the best loot in the game.  Other thought: - If you can play with friends, or find people to run through the game with, do it. It's much more fun that way. You can still enjoy it quite a bit single player, however... it's not the same when you can't laugh when someone gets destroyed by a boulder trap.  Story time (if you want to torture yourself and read my rambling):  I bought this game ages ago, back when it was still in development, before any of the expansions and cleanups it's gone through. I spent $10 on this.  Since then, the Dev team (at least back in 2014-2015 or so when I kept up with it) would post threads about once a month at the least to let people know what was planned/ the progress of the game. It kept getting updated, adding more content and mechanics. I remember being super excited when new weapon types were added, rare mounts were added. Accessories so your character can fly around the map? Gimme. Something I always admire too is Re-Logic did not simply focus on adding more stuff end game, they kept polishing up early game too, adding things like Ropes to make things easier until you get hookshots, simple versions of weapons you find later like Spears, wooden yo-yo, more early game magic items. It used to be a much less enjoyable, slower grind to get to mid game content where the pace picks up.  There were at least a couple times where the development with the game was supposedly going to halt, and I was satisfied with it then. I'd gotten more content and enjoyment out of Terraria than most games I'd bought for $30 or more. Yet somehow, maybe a year after hearing nothing, a new content update would surprisingly be pushed out. This happened at least twice, when I thought it would be laid to rest as is.  I spent $10 on this.";Feedback

97; "You're probably here to look for the counter-arguments against Terraria, but are frustrated to find only dumb or fake reviews telling you "just buy it/what are you doing viewing negative for terrria lmao lol kk". Well, I'm here to tell the truth, and while I think this is an excellent game, there are things to watch out for (not necessarily cons, but things you personally might dislike):  - This is, by nature of its premise, a very "look it up yourself" game. The game has improved a lot on the aspect of giving you more ways to find things on your own, but it's still not nearly enough. Like Minecraft, GMod, Don't Starve, any other game of this type, you're probably better off having the wiki open at all times. - This is a grindy game. Whenever I start a campaign I usually put some podcast or music on, because a lot of the gameplay can be very mindless. Especially as you move past the big shift in the midgame, you'll find yourself in a lot of situations where the only way to move forward is to go to a specific location and just grind for a while, or start a specific event and just grind for a while. It's very much that type of game. There are mods that solve this if you want, but I'm talking specifically about the vanilla game here, and even with mods you really can't escape the fact that the meat of this game is pretty much the grind, you're just getting less meat in that case. - That also plays into my next point, this game is long. It's NOT a concise game. If you're taking it slow, putting effort into building, trying to explore as much as you can, etc... you might play 100 hours and the game won't even be close to over. - This game is piss easy. Even on Expert Mode, if you're not a child and have any game experience at all you'll breeze through most of it. With later updates they added a new "Master Mode" which is actually difficult, but it's essentially just a damage slider kind of difficulty and not really all that fun or interesting. Again, there are mods that fix this by adding new difficulties that are far better thought out and make the game way more interesting and less stale. - While playing alone is still fun and valid, this game improves tenfold when playing with other people. Adding people to the mix makes it sooo much better and breathes new life into the game. It is unfortunate then, that the multiplayer is coded like ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Not only does the game becoming way more demanding on your system exclusively during multiplayer (especially for the host), unless you're all playing on the same LAN or something the lag is basically inescapable. To play Terraria multiplayer is to come to terms with the fact that the game will become unplayable at complete random and you just have to hope it'll not be during an important fight.  Just getting this out of my stomach. This is not a negative review per se, I still think Terraria is an amazing game (look at my playtime!), but this ♥♥♥♥ is seriously pissing me off.";Feedback

On the Rimworld side they could add in some of the corporations as factions in the world along with their cyberware and you would need to be on good terms with that faction in order to buy their unique goods.

108; "Need More Normal, Functional Vehicles in Sequels The population of vehicles is TOO weird in CP77.  What I mean is that its not a normal S curve. Most vehicles on the road should just be people trying to get around, and their choice in cars should reflect that. Instead, V is the only one driving a regular car and everyone else is driving a 1960's Cadillac sloop with chrome paint and 6 wheels, or a fully up-armored off-road vehicle with no glass and missiles on the back. SOME people in Night City are supposed to be extravagantly wealthy, while MOST people are poor and SOME of those poor people might trick out their cars. By having MOST of the NPCs drive oddities, you really under cut that narrative.  I will say the same thing of the designs. None of the vehicle designs are very functional. Re-thinking the concept of taillights is a great idea but just putting 2 tradtional taillights on one side of the vehicle ... isn't great. The point of lights on either side of the car is so to aid other drivers in telling how far away the car is. Thats never an issue in CP77, because its never actually dark..... but still.  In design, cars are always going to be about the same their function as a method transportation will always be the same. No one is ever going to design a bus that seats 4 people, because the point of the bus is to move a lot of people around on 4 wheels. Besides the Hella and whatever the Delamains are, there are very few normal, functional car designs.  The functional difference between these sedans and the rest of the vehicles is negligible, except that they look all crazy.

110; "Multi-Millions dollar suggestion I think it would be great to add a 'Gauntlet Tower' type of feature where you would have a gigantic building to save someone or acquire an item ( Ex: computer files ).  This building would be special as you could enhance the difficulty ( easy, normal, hard, Mission Impossible ) mode. Hello Tom Cruise.  Building should have 100 floors. As you keep moving upward, NPC and security becomes more difficult.  Higher stage, there would be stronger opponent. Each 5 floor should have a 'mini-boss' who's super hard to kill.  You would have a 'timer' to complete the entire floors. ( or no timers. be reward would be lower )  Each floor should be different, but also, should have different obstacles. Don't make it all the same. Ex: Add laser. Add poison room with timer ( find the exit or die in the poison ). Add, different passages to bypass enemies ( if you can find them ). Add different type of NPC that attacks you on each floor. Don't put the same NPC if possible.  Each time you succeed 10 floors, you get to chose a 'reward'. Rewards will depend on how 'fast' you reached and complete all 10th floor.  Upon success, all next 10th floor should be harder. And so on and so on.  At some points, you could even have 'Zombies' swarming some rooms? Why not. Who doesn't like zombies trying to eat you alive while you pull your triggers like there was no tomorrow? I know I do.  The goal of this feature would be to bring great 'Challenges' to new or veteran players while rewarding them for advancing. The issue in this game... not enough challenges. Things are too easy. Somewhat.  You can also add achievements + Ranks for ""Best player who reach 100th floor + some stats on your website for all to see.

This feature can also be "Free" ( which many would rejoice ) or added in a new DLC.

For example gigs (green exclamation mark perhaps?) and requests for help (red hostile markers maybe?).  So comparable to the stuff we can do in the 'AMM' mod, with the exception that you can save your work and have it appear on the map. This could also tie into the Steam workshop.  I can't help but be convinced that if CDPR would get into contact with the authors behind AMM then it shouldn't be too difficult to get the basic routines going. And it would allow the community to create tons of extra contents and share our stories of NC.  Ey, one can only hope, right?";Feature
121; "Suggestion - give us a 2.0 game mechanic overhaul opt out. I know, I know, this is a big ask and it's not likely to happen but I'm going to ask anyway.  I like some of the 2.0+ changes such as the improved police mechanics and shooting from vehicles but I do not like the overhaul to the core game mechanics that came along with 2.0+ and I do not want it.  What I do not want from 2.0+ are the major changes that were made to the core mechanics because they make the game nothing but a pale shadow of what it once was. After playing again recently this game now feels like a hollow and generic experience where all I need to so is grab cover then spam grenades and spam healing to win fights. It's nowhere near as much fun as it used to be. The gear I pick up doesn't matter now, clothing/armour/helmets don't matter anymore, my guns barely matter, no grenades or healing items to pick up anymore, no need to stock up before a big fight anymore.... you get the point.  I want to opt out of all of the core mechanic changes that happened in 2.0. I want the core mechanics from the game I purchased. To be a bit more specific - I want to go back to the old perk system, the old grenade/medical item system, the old perk/attribute system, the old clothing and weapon upgrade and mod systems, the old cyberware system, the old non-level scaling enemies system. While I appreciate having the 1.63 version available on the beta tab I would like CD Projekt Red to give us something more than that because not everything in 2.0+ has been bad.";Feature

129; "As a long-time Sims player, I was always optimistic about InZoi after seeing it's initial reveal trailer, and I have to say it has really impressed me. If you love the life simulation genre but have felt frustrated with The Sims 4's endless DLC model and limitations, InZoi is absolutely worth checking out.  Right off the bat, the level of customization is fantastic. The character creator is incredibly detailed, allowing for more realistic and unique Zois right from the start. The graphics are also a huge step up from The Sims 4, with smoother animations and a more natural look.  One of the biggest wins for InZoi is its open-ended gameplay. Instead of being locked into rigid, pre-designed interactions, it feels like you have more organic ways to develop relationships, careers, and daily life. The open world is also a huge improvement over The Sims' instanced neighborhoods. You are free to explore seamlessly without loading screens breaking immersion, making the world feel more alive and connected. You are also in direct control of your Zoi, able to walk and run using traditional controls, rather than being locked to the 'click here to move' system, which is still present for those who want it.  On top of that, the developer actually listens to the community. After backlash about Denuvo being in the game, it was removed before launch, showing a real pro-gamer mindset. The dev has also stated that he wants InZoi to be highly moddable, which is a huge plus for anyone who loves community-driven content. Unlike EA's approach of locking features behind expensive DLC, the creator seems focused on giving players real freedom and customization options.  It is still early and there is room to grow, but the foundation here is solid. If you have been craving a life sim that moves the genre forward and actually respects its players, InZoi is absolutely worth keeping an eye on.";Feedback
130; "First of all, let's give a huge shoutout to the developers of inZOI. Recently, they made a decision that has won the hearts of many players: removing Denuvo. For those who might not know, Denuvo is a copy protection system that often ends up hurting the game's performance. By removing this barrier, inZOI not only runs smoother but also opens up the possibility for modding - which is a huge win for the creative community.  Yes, you read that right: the game is faster, lighter, and has way more potential for customization. This was a brilliant move for those who want to see inZOI expand in unexpected ways, with mods bringing fresh new experiences and ideas to the game.  What stands out even more is the developers' commitment to listening to community feedback. This isn't something you see every day, but inZOI has really set itself apart in this regard. They don't just make the necessary changes—they do it quickly, responding to player requests and adapting in real-time. This makes all the difference! After all, when developers listen to their players, it's clear they're dedicated to improving the game and delivering a richer experience.  And honestly, the future of inZOI has never looked so bright. With these changes, it's obvious that the game has huge potential to continue growing and attracting an even bigger fan base. The community is stronger than ever, and the developers know exactly how to keep that fire alive. It's clear that inZOI isn't just a game, it's a living, evolving platform where players have a voice.  So, kudos to the developers! The game is in great hands, and I can't wait to see where this journey takes us.  The future really does look bright for inZOI.";Feedback

My male Zoi is mean all the time for some reason, even when I turn off his free will he goes to my female Zoi to be mean (they are bffs, true lovers and have almost everything in common). Even one bad interaction lowers their love relationship so this whole thing feels repetetive and like it's going nowhere  I know it's early access but I feel like interactions are so important to build a life here and they're not easy to do as of now.

Regardless if its dish just made which has not been consumed yet. Could fix that to either just wash the dish you are currently selecting or look for those that are empty/dirty.  -Rain appears inside homes if you live in an apartment. Its just a visual effect but its kind of annoying.  -Sometimes Zoi's are stuck in the running status. This cant be toggled with shift.  -Needs are filled way too easily, food regardless of quality is too fulfilling. You can eat a salad and it fills your Zoi the same as other more complex dishes.  -Ingredients are a good way to give the player more stuff to do around (fishing, planting, etc). Problem is you can only hold them in your bag. There is no place to put your ingredients (fridge or something else). Sweet potatoes are the worst offender as they cant even be added to your bag.  -Relationships (be it friends/work/romatic) is raised waaaaay too quickly. Personalities dont clash enough.  -Emotions could be something really interesting, but right now it provides nothing besides a pair of options. They go away too quickly, and dont affect your conversations/thinking/reactions enough.  -Karma moves around way too fast too and it doesnt affect the world enough at the moment.

Resource location on the map The map is huge — which is a big plus — but since there are many different resources spread all over, it becomes hard to remember exactly where to find them. In the crafting table, when checking the required components, it would be really helpful to indicate the biome or village where that resource is most commonly found (or even the closest location). 3. Automatic display of nearby NPC names Without necessarily showing all NPCs on the map, it would be useful if their names automatically appeared above their heads when you’re within a few meters of them, without needing to hover your mouse over them.

246; "This game is for a very particular type of person - someone who enjoys both puzzles AND rogue-likes. It's an unusual combination, and I think many of the negative reviews are from either puzzle fans who either don't like or aren't familiar with the way one progresses through a rogue-like game, or from rogue-like fans who find the switch to progressing through puzzles vs combat to be obtuse and frustrating. But if you're someone who actually likes both kinds of games, then you'll REALLY enjoy this, especially as a wonderfully novel and unique experience.  The key to really enjoying the game, I think, is to remember that you progress through your own knowledge. Early on, you'll encounter a note suggesting that you might want to take notes. Please follow that advice. There are a huge number of subtle details that can provide a great deal of information and guidance, and which I'm sure the game would be much more frustrating if you either aren't pay enough attention to notice them, or if you're not writing them down so you forget them later when it turns out to be relevant.  In particular, the player needs to learn the patterns of how certain rooms are drawn, and I don't just mean the obvious cases where the game spells out that taking a certain action will add a new room to your list of blueprints. There are patterns such as rooms that only appear on the west-most or east-most sides of the house, or the fact that a room, built for the day, will typically not appear as a blueprint option again. There are a huge number of patterns like this, and you need to learn them and use them to your advantage. Or else, yes, this will be a frustrating game. I think many players are treating the game as if the puzzles only exist INSIDE the rooms, but the truth is that most of the puzzles ARE the rooms - you need to puzzle out how to place the rooms to maximize the chances of getting the draws you need. Of course there are still randomized elements, but, to be quite honest, if you're here to leave a review about how you've been waiting for a particular room to show up for multiple hours, that's probably a sign that you're missing something important about how that blueprint is drawn, and are perhaps sabotaging your own efforts without realizing it.";Feedback
247; "A lot of the negative reviews are from folks that seem to have been enticed by all the 10/10 from critics and then felt cheated when the game didn't immediately reveal its whole hand. I'm not saying anyone's wrong for not enjoying the early game, but with so many negative reviews that clearly didn't stick around long enough to find the good ♥♥♥♥, it's worth setting the record straight.  this game IS fantastic. It's my personal GOTY so far, but it requires time, patience, and observation. It does not hold your hand. If you liked Lorelei and the Laser Eyes, you'll probably love Blue Prince. There is so many cool layers to this that are really rewarding to find. It really is best to go in knowing as little as possible, though ironically it's probably this recommendation from critics that has pulled in so many players who had no idea what the game would require from them.  If RNG pisses you off or if you aren't willing to spend a bit of time actually paying attention to clues, it's probably going to annoy the ♥♥♥♥ out of you. You can believe the negative reviews on that. But if you see any claiming that 'there's nothing there' or that the puzzles are nothing but math or simple logic puzzles, that is a person who got so little into it that they only saw 2% of the game. Just so you know.";Feedback
248; "This game has amazing atmosphere and is incredibly compelling and mysterious, but unfortunately at this point I've only been playing out of hope that maybe the next layer of secrets is the one that makes it all worth it.  There's a decent 5-10h escape room here, but it's buried underneath 50h+ of really dull and increasingly annoying roguelike board game walking simulator. The pacing is chaotic and variable. At every turn, the game makes pretty overt anti-QoL decisions designed to waste your time. Unlike many games, these design choices feel very deliberate, not a result of a lack of care, and it becomes increasingly grating when you want to engage with the puzzles but the game just wants you to grind and invest more and more time. Is doing basic arithmetic hundreds of times fun? Do you want to solve puzzles in screenshots instead of in game? Is rerolling for hours to get access to the puzzle you already know how to solve fun? Is solving a 46 question timed (IRL) lore exam in pen fun? For me, no.  There's something incredibly cool and interesting here, but it's mired in so many confounding execution choices that it feels like a chore to play. So many things the game does just "feel bad" (I don't want to spoil anything for anyone who can enjoy this so I'm being vague, sorry). Big, telegraphed puzzles accomplish almost nothing. "Insignificant" minor choices and luck can completely turn a run around. Routine tasks are mind-numbing and unnecessarily slow. The game consistently gives off the impression that it doesn't particularly care about any of that and you're meant to engage with it on its terms. That's a lot to ask, and if a game does, it better deliver a payoff that makes it worth it. So far, it hasn't.  The highs have been mid and the lows have been very low. I've run out of sunk cost to give. It's time to admit there just isn't enough interesting content there to justify the investment and I haven't really been enjoying it: it's just a neverending tease of promise.

There are way too many elements that need to occur at the same time to clear a run: spawning a lever and spawning a greenhouse at the same time, spawnind a great hall and managing to have just enough key to find a lever, spawning a secret garden key (which is the easiest way).

The animation, art, and sound design are all present and honestly top quality, but for some reason, the execution of the whole package falls flat due to lackluster gameplay. It’s kind of ironic because Turkish indie games usually have the opposite issue—good gameplay but poor art direction.  And for context, I’ve played object-finding games in the past—it’s not like I’m completely unfamiliar with the genre. They just made it poorly. I’m not claiming to be a master of game design in this area, but even in the first few scenes, finding objects felt like a chore rather than something enjoyable.  I’ve played hundreds of games and can’t just give this one a pass simply because it’s Turkish. I believe the overwhelmingly positive reviews are mostly due to the game being somewhat well-known within the Turkish indie game community.  But this shouldn’t affect anyone’s review. Internationally, if this game had received more attention, I believe it would’ve been roasted and ended up with a 60–70 Metacritic score. It’s really sad how our most hyped-up games are only on par with low-quality titles from international developers.  P.S: Works well with the Steam Deck  ";Feedback
283; "- There are a lot of tiny details that make it feel the whole game was made with love  - The art is beautiful  - The music and sounds are amazing  - This game constantly puts you in different environments with different mechanics, which keeps it very fresh  - I really enjoyed the narrator and narration  - I recommend it to anyone who enjoys point & click games. Especially if you feel overwhelmed by life, this game might help you feel a little better — at least it did for me.";Feedback
284; "it's become very difficult to find games that evoke such deep emotional feelings. Leyla does it in a very balanced and beautiful flow and takes you on a journey that you may not like very much. Personally, I'm afraid of plays like this, it can be a bit impressive to experience someone else's feelings so deeply. But as I said, it's very hard to find games like this nowadays and I have to give credit to Leila for doing it so well. ";Feedback
285; "eila draws you into the delicate world of a woman piecing together fragments of her past. From the first scene, there's a haunting sincerity to the story—every moment feels personal, almost too real. It's not just a game, it's an emotional excavation.  The hand-drawn visuals and soft music wrap around you like a memory you forgot you had. As you move through Leila’s world, you don’t just witness her emotions—you carry them. It’s draining in the most beautiful way, like finishing a heartfelt letter you weren’t ready to write.  This is a game that doesn’t ask you to save the world—it asks you to sit with its pain, its tenderness, and its truth. And somehow, that feels even more heroic.  I was left in tears of emotional happiness at the end of it! definitely worth getting";Feedback
286; " The game's most striking feature is undoubtedly its art style. The hand-drawn animations are nothing short of breathtaking. Each frame feels lovingly crafted, imbued with a delicate, almost nostalgic quality.  The story's interesting. It's not some grand, epic quest. It's about Leila, this seemingly ordinary woman, and you're piecing together her life through these memories. The puzzles? They're not brain-busters, but they fit perfectly with the story. They're like little metaphors, you know? Like, you're not just solving a puzzle, you're figuring out a part of Leila's past, or her feelings. It's clever.  If you're into narrative-driven games, and you don't mind a slower pace, give this game a shot. It's a quiet little gem, and it might just surprise you. I would recommend this game as its super amazing.  ";Feedback

By hour two, your PC is covered in condensation, and by hour five, mushrooms start growing on your keyboard.

291; "I have over 400 games on my account across 16 years, and an average of 20% completion across them all. 80 Games I've completed in that span. That equals out to around 5 games a year with an average completion time of around 2.5 months per game I've actually finished.   At the time I'm posting this, I bought this game two days ago at approximately 7 pm. I have been incapable of putting it down.  The story is phenomenal. The game play is phenomenal. The character design and pacing is phenomenal. The mechanics are phenomenal. The graphics are phenomenal.  I haven't felt this way over a video game in years. It was enjoyable from start to finish, and even on the standard difficulty still provided ample challenge for my geriatric middle aged ass. It's rare that I come across a title that I'd be willing to play through multiple times but I think I found the latest addition.  If any of you are even remotely considering buying this title, take it from somebody who's never once felt the need to write a review for ANY game before and go on this adventure.  Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk.";Feedback
292; "im making this comment as someone who has finished the game before. the animation quality is like an advanced and faster version of RDR2. the facial expressions, voice acting, and atmosphere are of a quality that is very hard to find in other games. Maybe we don't all fully agree on the story, but it still manages to draw you in. there's top tier craftsmanship here. It's a favorite of mine, and i recommend everyone to play Part 1 and Part 2 at least once.";Feedback

296; "While this game boasts incredible visuals, detailed animations, and intense action sequences, I found myself conflicted about the overall experience. The storyline is where it fell short for me. Character deaths often felt unnecessary, and many of the protagonists made decisions that were difficult to relate to, which ultimately made it hard to connect with or care about their outcomes. This does not mean is a bad game. just had a big expectation since the first one was amazing. The roguelike mode highlights how much fun the combat is without the need for its nonsensical story.  Overall i would not recommend the game if it's for the story. ";Feedback

Created immense fatigue while playing longer quest in side stories that I really didn't care about. No real changes to the solid game play and overall the graphics are really solid. Just wish the story was either more interesting overall or the more drawn out parts were cut/shorter.";Feedback
